        <h3>Meet Jerry</h3>
        <p>Jerry is a playful and loyal pet dog, always full of energy and ready for an adventure. With his shiny coat and bright eyes, he’s a constant source of joy and laughter in the household. Whether he’s chasing after his favorite tennis ball or curling up on the couch for a nap, Jerry knows how to bring comfort and excitement to everyone around him.

            One of Jerry's favorite activities is going for walks. The moment the leash comes out, his tail starts wagging uncontrollably, and he’s practically bouncing with excitement. He loves exploring the neighborhood, sniffing every tree and greeting every passerby with a friendly bark and wag of his tail.</p>

        <h3>Meet Tom</h3>
        <p>         
            Tom is a sleek, independent, and ever-curious pet cat who loves to keep everyone on their toes. With his soft fur and bright, mischievous eyes, he’s the perfect balance of elegance and playful energy. Tom isn’t the type of cat to demand attention constantly, but when he wants it, you’ll know. Whether it’s a gentle nudge of his head or a soft purr as he curls up beside you, Tom always knows how to get exactly what he wants.One of Tom’s favorite pastimes is exploring every nook and cranny of the house. From the highest shelves to the smallest corners, no place is safe from his curious nature.
